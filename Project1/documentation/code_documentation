Programming UI and Language: 
We decided to build the battleship game with the terminal as the User Interface and Python as our coding language.

Overview: (what the game should look like)
The two players decide on the number of ships (1-5) at the beginning of the game and input the number into the terminal when prompted.
Then, each player will place their ships and before handing the device to the other player, the screen will clear to keep the ship placements confidential.
The game then begins and the players take turns choosing where to strike their opponent. 
They will be given a screen of their board with what spots have been hit by their opponents, and a board of the spots they have hit of their opponents.
The terminal screen will clear between each turn to keep the ship placements confidential. 
When one player has sunken all the other players ships, the terminal displays an "END GAME: PLAYER x WON" message, then exits the program/game.
